# JSON-based-Inventory-Management-System-ETG-Skill-India-Internship
This is a JSON Based Inventory Management System.

I have made an inventory management system which works on NoSQL based dataset.
I have two JSON files, 'record.json' and 'sales.json'.
New Inventories can be added and simultaneously get updated in 'record.json'.
Purchasing items can be done by the customer and simultaneously get updated in 'record.json'and 'sales.json'.
When a customer purchase any item, it is checked whether the item matches the product Id or not.
If the quantity of a product that the customer wants to purchase exceeds the originally available quantity, approprite message is displayed and the purchase can't be made.
Total Bill amount is generated based on the purchases made.
Each transaction made by the customer is updated accordingly to the 'sales.json' file.
Each transactions display the product Id, quantity purchased and total bill amount.



# I have added 5 features per product id:
Product name
Price
Quantity
Date of Manufacture
Date of Expiry

# My project can do the following things:
1.Adding items to the inventory
2.Updating the inventory after adding items
3.Purchaing items by Customers from the Inventory
4.Updating the inventory after purchase
5.Generating the bill after every purchase of product
6.Generates sales.json file which contains all the transactions.
