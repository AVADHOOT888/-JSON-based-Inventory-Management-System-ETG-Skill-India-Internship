# JSON-based-Inventory-Management-System-ETG-Skill-India-Internship
This is a JSON Based Inventory Management System.

I have made an inventory management system which works on NoSQL based dataset.<br>
I have two JSON files, 'record.json' and 'sales.json'.<br>
New Inventories can be added and simultaneously get updated in 'record.json'.<br>
Purchasing items can be done by the customer and simultaneously get updated in 'record.json'and 'sales.json'.<br>
When a customer purchase any item, it is checked whether the item matches the product Id or not.<br>
If the quantity of a product that the customer wants to purchase exceeds the originally available quantity, approprite message is displayed and the purchase can't be made.<br>
Total Bill amount is generated based on the purchases made.<br>
Each transaction made by the customer is updated accordingly to the 'sales.json' file.<br>
Each transactions display the product Id, quantity purchased and total bill amount.<br>



# I have added 5 features per product id:
1. Product name<br>
2. Price<br>
3. Quantity<br>
4. Date of Manufacture<br>
5. Date of Expiry<br>

# My project can do the following things:
1. Adding items to the inventory<br>
2. Updating the inventory after adding items<br>
3. Purchaing items by Customers from the Inventory<br>
4. Updating the inventory after purchase<br>
5. Generating the bill after every purchase of product<br>
6. Generates sales.json file which contains all the transactions.<br>
